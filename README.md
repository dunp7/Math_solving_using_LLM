# Enhancing Hallucination Detection in Math Word Problems with Prompting Optimization

This repository is part of my thesis, titled **"Enhancing Hallucination Detection in Math Word Problems with Prompting Optimization"**, where a refined framework for detecting hallucinations in language models applied to math word problems is presented.

## Project Description

The project focuses on improving hallucination detection specifically for math word problems by optimizing the prompting strategy. We introduce techniques to enhance the model's ability to interpret math word problems more accurately, reducing errors or hallucinations that may arise from ambiguous or unclear prompts.

The primary innovation in this work is the use of **prompt optimization** to increase the reliability of AI model outputs when solving math word problems. By refining the modelâ€™s input prompts, we aim to reduce hallucinations and ensure more accurate results in problem-solving.


## Installation and Usage
 We recommend using a virtual environment, like Conda, to install the necessary packages.
 We use **Python 3.12.5** and **Pytorch 12.4**.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunp7/Prompt-Optimization-in-Hallucination-Detection.git
   ```
   
2. Install Pytorch following the instructions from the official [website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open and execute the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

To use the code, simply run the [notebook](Notebooks).
